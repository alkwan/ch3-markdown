# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# cat
```
$ cat yourfilename
Prints the contents of your file.

$ cat yourfilename > otherfilename
Prints the contents of your file.
This step adds a line?
```

- Prints the contents of your file
  - Let's you see what's in the file
  - I don't really know what else
  - It's not a complicated command.
- Let's you add text to your file, too
  - Although I'm not sure how you do that.
  - Would be cool, though!
  - I guess I should find out.
